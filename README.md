# This repo is based on .Net7.
# Had issues with different versions of .Net for rpgAPITest project and rpgAPI project, so please convert both to .Net 7.0 only.

## `dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=lcov /p:CoverletOutput=lcov.info` use this in rpgAPITest project to run the unit test and generate report.

## Do check whether all dependencies and packages are already installed on your machine by .csproj file.
